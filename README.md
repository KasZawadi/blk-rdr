A online learning resource


This is an ongoin prokect, the idea is it will be a resource that creates a community for people to read work from black, and other poc authors who might not be getting that much attention. 

On top of it I'm implimenting ways to help people shop localy for the books they want from real people. 

I know books can be expensive so I'll try to impliment more functions that help search for better deals if you choose to outsource your bussiness.
